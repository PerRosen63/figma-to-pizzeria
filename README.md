## About the design
We opted for a design featuring blue and white as the primary colors, inspired by the flag of Greece. We all shared a nostalgic fondness for a somewhat shabby pizzeria, but when it came to designing one, it felt wrong not to do it justice. Hence, we crafted a relatively polished website for Georgios.

The fonts we selected resonated well with the vibe we aimed to convey. They exude a sense of harmlessness and playfulness while also carrying a touch of "restaurant" and "Greek" essence for some inexplicable reason.

For the buttons, we chose slightly rounded corners to evoke a friendly and inviting feel, striking a balance between softness and maintaining a sense of professionalism.

Overall, our design decisions were guided by a desire to pay homage to the Greek heritage while infusing a fresh, welcoming atmosphere into Georgios Pizzeria's digital presence.
