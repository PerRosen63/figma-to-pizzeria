## About the Design
We opted for a design featuring blue and white as the primary colors, inspired by the flag of Greece. We all shared a nostalgic fondness for a somewhat shabby pizzeria, but when it came to designing one, it felt wrong not to do it justice. Hence, we crafted a relatively polished website for Georgios.

The fonts we selected resonated well with the vibe we aimed to convey. They exude a sense of harmlessness and playfulness while also carrying a touch of "restaurant" and "Greek" essence for some inexplicable reason.

For the buttons, we chose slightly rounded corners to evoke a friendly and inviting feel, striking a balance between softness and maintaining a sense of professionalism.

Overall, our design decisions were guided by a desire to pay homage to the Greek heritage while infusing a fresh, welcoming atmosphere into Georgios Pizzeria's digital presence.

## Coding the Design
We recieved a design for a pizzeria owned by Georgio and decided to implement it as a simple webpage using HTML, SCSS, and vanilla JavaScript. To build and manage the project, we chose Vite as our build tool, enabling fast development and easy resource management.

We opted to keep the site independent of databases and instead used an array to store the pizzeria's menu. This allowed us to dynamically display menu items on various parts of the site.

### Working Methods
We utilized GitHub Issues and Projects to organize our workflow. By defining tasks in Issues and assigning them to team members, we could effectively track what was done and what remained to be completed. We also followed the "mobile first" principle in developing the site, implementing and testing for mobile devices first, then adapting for other platforms.

### Coding Techniques
- **Hover Effects:** Implemented hover effects on buttons and navigation items to enhance user interactivity.
- **SVG Usage:** Incorporated SVG files for graphical elements, allowing color changes on hover and click events.
- **Responsive Design:** Adapted elements' placement based on the platform, ensuring optimal viewing experience across different devices.
